These two scripts were applied to PET 11C-Methionine uptake data of seventy patients with brain neoplasms to evaluate the difference between 8 distinct uptake characteristics that were measured on four particular uptake intervals.
The paper about time bias and variability of MET-PET measurement is in production.

Met_Intervals_statistics.py compute and represent descriptive statistics of the uptake characteristics at distinct time intervals.
Difference_statistics.py compute and represent descriptive statistics (several approaches) of the differences between uptake values on the different intervals.
